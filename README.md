## SEO Marketing Website

### Description

A clean search engine optimisation marketing landing page for the customer to read and understand the services offered.
I created a clean sematic HTML structure for the skeleton and adjusted the CSS with smooth scrolling and proper class names
to make sure all the layout styles are applied correctly.
The point of this project was to make a very convenient collection of details and highlight to the customer what the company can offer.

This is a graded assignment for module one of edX's Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
<br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
<br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
<br>
HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
<br>
Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
<br>
Heading attributes fall in sequential order
<br>
Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

### Usage

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
